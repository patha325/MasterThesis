Avoid using the BibTeX entry provided by CDS as it is: CDS presently treats all ATLAS Notes as "Technical Report", this would add an ugly "Tech. Rep." to your bibliographic entry. You %use user the BibTeX "Article" class for an ATLAS Note entry, following this example: 
Article{ATLAS-CONF-2010-999,
 author  = "{ATLAS Collaboration}",
 title   = "{Place your title here}",
 report  = "ATLAS-CONF-2010-999",
 url     = "https://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/12345"

@Article{Duck:2005,
  author =   {Duck, Donald},
  title =    {The History of Automatic Control},
  journal =  {Duckburg Journal of Science},
  year =     2005,
  volume =   106,
  number =   3,
  pages =    {345--401},
}

@article{CERN-PH-EP-2012-210,
	author	= {ATLAS Collaboration},
	title	= {Search for dark matter candidates and large extra
                       dimensions in events with a jet and missing transverse
                       momentum with the ATLAS detector},
      journal       = {J. High Energy Phys.},
      collaboration = {},
      number        = {arXiv:1210.4491. CERN-PH-EP-2012-210},
      volume        = 04,
      pages         = {075. 58 p},
      month         = Oct,
      year          = 2012,
