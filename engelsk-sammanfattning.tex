Something as an introduction:

The \abbrLHC at \abbrCERN is undergoing an upgrade to increase the center of mass energy for the colliding particles which means that new physical processes will be explored. One drawback of this is that it will be harder to isolate unique particle collisions since more and more collisions will occur simultaneously, so called pile-up. 

One hope for the upgrade is that \abbrWIMP models of dark matter will be detected.

This thesis covers looking at effective operators which try to explain dark matter without adding new theories to the standard model or \abbrQFT . 
 

Some results and a slight conclusion.
