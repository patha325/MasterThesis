I wish to dedicate this thesis to my mathematics teacher Ulf Rydmark without whom I would not have studied physics.

A big thank you to my family, fiancée and friends who have supported me throughout my education. A warm thank you to my friend Joakim Skoog who altered some of the images for me.

I want to thank my supervisor Christophe Clément and all those who helped me at Stockholm University. \\
I also want to thank my examiner Magnus Johansson, who always took time to answer any question from and support his students. \\ 
A special thank you to Professor Irina Yakimenko who was responsible for my profile in physics.
