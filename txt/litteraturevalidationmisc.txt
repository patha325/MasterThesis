Avoid using the BibTeX entry provided by CDS as it is: CDS presently treats all ATLAS Notes as "Technical Report", this would add an ugly "Tech. Rep." to your bibliographic entry. You use user the BibTeX "Article" class for an ATLAS Note entry, following this example: 
@Article{ATLAS-CONF-2010-999,
 author  = "{ATLAS Collaboration}",
 title   = "{Place your title here}",
 report  = "ATLAS-CONF-2010-999",
 url     = "https://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/12345"

CHECK IF THEY ARE PUBLIC!

Performance inputs to the 2012 European Strategy studies.7/10-12
Motivation to why smearing is used. Smearing due to detector effects,(energy resolution) expected results for electron, tauon.

Seams similar to what I am doing, though in a lesser scale:

Very good introduction to what I am doing, and how/why.

Intresting information about MC truth. Something about the data is needed however.
